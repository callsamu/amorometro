# Amorometro

Amorometro is the final version of [Lovecalc](https://github.com/callsamu/lovecal).
It uses Next.js in order to optimize the website for search engines while keeping
the user experience smooth (not requiring full page refreshes, contrary to it's
predecessor). It also supports PWA capabilities.
